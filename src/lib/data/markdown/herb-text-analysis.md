# Personal Thoughts

Look at these data!

# Description

This is a group side project for CUHK University Library. I collaborated with Nick Wu and Juno Yau to create a data visualization website for different scholars to study the relationship of different ingredients in ancient Chinese medicine recipes. The relationship was displayed in interactive cluster graphs, with coloring representing the nature of the ingredients (whether it is "warm" or "cold").

## Tech Used

**OCR technology** was applied to extract the text data from scanned images of ancient Chinese medicine book _Collected Exegesis of Recipes_. **Python** was then used for data cleaning and extraction of ingredients within different recipes.Lastly, **Plotly** was used for data visualization. The results were exhibited via **GitHub** Page.

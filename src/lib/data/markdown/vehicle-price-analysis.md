"BRING BALANCE TO GPA, NOT LEAVE IT IN DARKNESS!"<br>

# Description

This is a group project for SEEM2460, which I worked with Colin Lo and Felix Lam. The project spanned 1 week and aimed to mitigate the ambiguous pricing problem in the US used vehicle market with various parametric and non-parametric techniques.

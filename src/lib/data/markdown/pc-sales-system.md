# Personal Thoughts

I was too lazy, just copying these from Colin Lo's description.

# Description

This is a collaborative project undertaken by me, Colin Lo, and Jimmy Lau, aimed at creating a Sales System program that simulates real-life transactions.
<br><br>
Our project began with designing the data schema for the sales system. Subsequently, we developed a sales system specifically tailored for a computer part store. This system effectively stores all relevant information pertaining to transactions, computer parts, and salespersons. Users can interactively inquire about various aspects of the system.
<br><br>

## Functionality

1. **Administrator**<br><br>

   1. Create table schemas in the database
   2. Delete table schemas in the database
   3. Load data from a dataset
   4. Show the content of a specified table
      <br><br>

2. **Manager**<br><br>

   1. List all salespersons in ascending or descending order of years of experience
   2. Count the number of transaction records of each salesperson within a given range on years of experience
   3. Sort and list the manufacturers in descending order of total sales value
   4. Show the N most popular parts
      <br><br>

3. **Salesperson**<br><br>

   1. Search for Parts
   2. Perform transactions

## Tech Used

To achieve this project, we utilized the **Java JDBC** API in conjunction with the **MySQL** database system

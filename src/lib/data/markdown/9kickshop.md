# Personal Thoughts

I survived CSCI3100!

# Description

This is a group project for my CSCI3100 course in CUHK and my first web application project. The project took around 1 month to complete. Working along with other 4 students (Nick Wu, Hillton Ho, Felix Lam, Colin Lo), I was responsible for most of the UI and front-end development.
<br><br>
The goal of this project is to provide an online shopping platform for 9Kicks, a fashion footwear business. This online platform includes a client-facing platform which allows customers to login, browse, and purchase stylish shoes.Clients can search or filter the products, then save it to shopping cart for later purchase. What's more, clients are also able to rate and leave a review after a purchase for other users to see it.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the platform also provides a user and inventory management system for the business to manage the platform. The business will be able to add, edit and remove user and product information without the aid of developers.
<br><br>
The demo of this project is available at https://www.9kicks.shop/. However, for some reasons (a.k.a we could not afford the backend server running 24/7), the website would only showcase partial functionality.

## Tech Used

For back-end development, we used **Go** and **Kotlin**. **SvelteKit** and **TailwindCSS** were used in front-end development. Eventually, the web application was deployed on **AWS**. The UI was developed with **Figma** from scratch.

# Future Plan

This project is considered as Completed and there is no plan for enhancement.

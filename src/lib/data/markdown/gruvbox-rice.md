# Personal Thoughts

_I use arch, btw._<br>
_I use WM, btw._<br>

Just kidding, but most importantly,<br>
Linux >>>>>>>>>> Windows

# Description

This is a solo side project on Hyprland UI Customization and part of my Linux Customization Project. The project spanned around 1 week to finish. Inspired by the famous IDE color scheme GruvBox, this motivation of this project is to create a UI that strikes the balance between eye-strain prevention and readability.
<br><br>
Ultimately, the goal of the Linux customization project is to create an OS that is optimized for laptop usage. With Windows' disappointing performance on laptop, I decided to switch to Arch Linux, which provides advantages on less resource usage and full control of the computer. Meanwhile, the use of tilting window manager minimizes mouse usage, which enhances the portability of the laptop.

## Tech Used

**Shell** was used for developing some of the applet scripts.
The UI customization was mostly done with **CSS**.

# Future Plan

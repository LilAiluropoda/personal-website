# Personal Thoughts

Yayyyyyy I finally made up my mind and coded a personal website for myself. Shout out to my dude Colin for providing suggestions on the designs. I kinda tried my best on mimicking the UI on my Linux and hopefully you will like it and switch to Linux >:).

# Description

This is a solo project that I worked for showcasing my previous projects and practicing SvelteKit. The project took approximately 2 weeks (cuz I also had full time internship going on at that time). This website is static and fully responsive.

## Tech Used

I used **SvelteKit** for developing this website.<br>
For styling, I used **TailwindCSS** for most of the parts and little bit of **CSS** for some animations and layout.<br>
**Typescript** was used for some data extraction and processing logics.<br>
I used json files for storing the data so no database is used.<br>

# Future Plan

Add more pages for posting memes or blog, maybe.

# References

The design was inherited from my Linux Ricing Project.
